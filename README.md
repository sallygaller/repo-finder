# repo-finder
Thinkful module 12.6:
Your team is working on an app that will help recruiters review all of a candidate's information. You've been assigned to work on one feature for the app - to display a list of repos belonging to a particular GitHub handle. Users can enter a Github handle and repos associated with that handle will be displayed on the page.
